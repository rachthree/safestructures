# Installation and Requirements

`safestructures` requires Python 3.10 and above.

To install, simply run
```
pip install safestructures
```
This will also install the minimum dependencies, namely `safetensors` and `numpy`.

As for ML / tensor frameworks, `safestructures` expects `numpy` at minimum. To use `safestructures`'s PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX capabilities, the respective framework must be installed separately.
